# Software Engineering Practices in MAPE-K Water Utility Digital Twin

This project implements robust, production-grade software engineering practices for a modular MAPE-K architecture in a water utility digital twin system. Key practices include:

## 1. Modular Architecture
- Separation of concerns: Monitor, Analyze, Plan, Execute, Knowledge modules.
- Service and repository layers for business logic and data access.
- Domain-driven design for sensor models and entities.

## 2. Database Best Practices
- Normalized schema with clear entity relationships.
- Use of auto-increment primary keys and business-friendly codes.
- Connection pooling for efficient resource management.
- SQL parameterization to prevent injection.

## 3. Configuration Management
- Centralized config files for database, logging, and system settings.
- Environment-based configuration support.

## 4. Logging & Observability
- Structured logging to both console and file.
- Prometheus metrics integration for monitoring loop duration, sensor reads, and threshold violations.
- Error and warning logging for validation and runtime issues.

## 5. Validation & Data Quality
- Pydantic models for strict data validation.
- Custom validators for sensor ranges, timestamps, and node IDs.
- Data quality checks for outliers and stale data.

## 6. Asynchronous & Resilient Execution
- Async MAPE-K loop using asyncio for non-blocking operation.
- Circuit breaker pattern (pybreaker) for robust command execution.
- Retry logic for transient failures (tenacity).

## 7. Testability & Maintainability
- Unit test structure for services and use cases.
- Clear separation of test and production code.
- Linting and cognitive complexity warnings for maintainable code.

## 8. Security & Safety
- SQL parameterization for injection safety.
- State-driven planning and emergency handling.

## 9. Documentation & Readability
- Inline comments and docstrings for clarity.
- Markdown documentation for architecture and practices.

## 10. Extensibility
- Easily add new sensor types, plans, or business logic.
- Configurable thresholds and plan codes.
