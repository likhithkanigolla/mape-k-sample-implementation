# Advanced Testing Practices Needed

## Test Coverage
- Add pytest-cov for coverage reporting
- Aim for >80% test coverage
- Integration tests for MAPE-K pipeline

## Test Structure
- Add conftest.py for pytest fixtures
- Mock external dependencies (Redis, Database)
- Property-based testing with Hypothesis
- Performance/load testing for async components

## Quality Gates
- Add pre-commit hooks
- Add pytest.ini configuration
- Add tox.ini for testing across Python versions
