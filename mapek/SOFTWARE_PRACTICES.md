# Software & Design Practices in MAPE-K Water Utility Digital Twin

This implementation follows modern software engineering and design practices for reliability, maintainability, and extensibility in industrial IoT and digital twin systems.

## Architectural & Design Practices
- **Layered Architecture:** Clear separation between domain, application, infrastructure, and presentation layers.
- **MAPE-K Modularization:** Each phase (Monitor, Analyze, Plan, Execute, Knowledge) is implemented as a distinct, testable module/service.
- **Domain-Driven Design:** Sensor readings, plans, and entities are modeled as domain objects with validation and business logic.
- **Repository Pattern:** Data access is abstracted via repositories, supporting testability and decoupling from database specifics.
- **Service Layer:** Business logic and orchestration are encapsulated in service classes, not mixed with data or presentation code.
- **Configuration Management:** All environment, database, and system settings are centralized and environment-aware.

## Industry & Production Practices
- **Connection Pooling:** Efficient, scalable database access using connection pools.
- **Async Programming:** Non-blocking MAPE-K loop and command execution using Python asyncio.
- **Circuit Breaker & Retry:** pybreaker and tenacity ensure resilience against transient failures and external system faults.
- **Structured Logging:** All events, errors, and metrics are logged in a structured format, supporting observability and audit.
- **Prometheus Metrics:** Key system metrics are exposed for monitoring and alerting.
- **Validation & Data Quality:** Pydantic models enforce strict validation; custom logic checks for outliers, stale data, and business rules.
- **State-Driven Planning:** Plans are selected and executed based on system state, supporting business logic and safety requirements.
- **Security:** SQL parameterization, error handling, and separation of concerns reduce risk of injection and runtime faults.
- **Extensibility:** New sensor types, plans, and business rules can be added with minimal changes due to modular design.
- **Testability:** Unit test structure, clear separation of test and production code, and dependency injection support robust testing.
- **Maintainability:** Linting, cognitive complexity warnings, and code reviews ensure long-term maintainability.
- **Documentation:** Inline comments, docstrings, and markdown files document architecture, design, and operational practices.

## Implementation Highlights
- **MAPE-K Loop:** Asynchronous, resilient, and state-driven, orchestrating all phases with error handling and logging.
- **Sensor Data Flow:** Real sensor readings are validated, analyzed, and used for planning and execution, with full traceability.
- **Plan Selection:** Business-friendly codes and state logic drive plan selection and execution, supporting real-world operations.
- **Error Handling:** All errors are logged and handled gracefully, with fallback and retry logic for critical operations.
